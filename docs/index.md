## Welcome 
> Welcome to the official **R6 Recon Amphibot Project Report Website** for EGR 314. This site provides high-level overviews of **Team XPED's** modular UART-daisy-chained amphibious scout, from organization to final Innovation Showcase demo.

## Team Introduction
**Team XPED (302)** is committed to delivering an innovative exploration device through collaborative engineering, modular PCB design, and tactical demo execution.  
We prioritize standards-based UART communication, serial sensor/actuator integration, and role rotation as we develop the **R6 Siege Recon Amphibot**, a fragile FPV scout with land/water capabilities.  
Our work follows open communication, shared GitHub repositories, weekly syncs, and measurable milestones toward showcase success.

## Project Summary

Our project delivers the **R6 Siege Recon Amphibot**, a 3 PCB modular scout mimicking Rainbow Six Siege drone mechanics: camera/IMU/gas scanning, wheel propulsion on land, flip-out fins for water, and MQTT wireless control.  
The UART daisy-chained system (Sensor → Actuator → Ctrl → HMI) enables real-time hazard recon with PID pathing and fragile "destroy" feedback, meeting EGR314 requirements without waterproofing.  
Through breadboard validation, Cadence PCB iteration, and lab demos (table breach → tub swim), we create a scalable tactical exploration platform for the Innovation Showcase.
