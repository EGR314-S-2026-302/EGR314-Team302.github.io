## Team Charter

> **"Team XPED commits to modular mastery and tactical innovation, delivering the R6 Recon Amphibot through UART standards, equitable rotations, and relentless demo execution, exploring hazards as a united engineering force."**

Started Jan 15 Discord: Brainstormed "Exploration Device = tool for difficult terrains," listing underwater sky-drop mappers, volcanic probes, cave robots, modular bunches, mothership jettison chains (sonar stages → WiFi surface), R6 drone/rover hybrids (wheels + propellers/camera detach). Voted charter to unify process around EGR314 UART modularity for tactical showcase success.

## Product Mission Statement

> **"The R6 Siege Recon Amphibot scouts hazardous land/water terrains with fused FPV sensors and wireless commands, providing operators actionable data from environments too perilous for humans — modular, throwable, tactical."**

From [ProductPlan](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/product-mission/): Focused "why" (safe recon). Post-charter poll narrowed underwater/volcanic/cave bunches + mothership stages to R6 amphibot (wheels land, fins/propellers water, UART mothership link), prioritizes operator intel over complexity.
