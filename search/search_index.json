We defined an exploration device as any tool or system that can collect data from environments that are unknown, dangerous, or difficult for humans to access. Early on, we discussed whether our project should be a single standalone device or part of a larger system deployed from a \u201cmothership,\u201d such as a drone, rover, boat, or satellite. As we talked through these options, we quickly realized that our team size of three, limited budget, and overall project scope made very large or complex systems unrealistic for this semester. This pushed us toward ideas that are achievable now but still leave room for future expansion.</p> <p>We considered several possible environments for exploration, including underwater areas, volcanic regions, and caves. In all of these cases, the common goal was to collect data from places where sending a human would be unsafe or impractical. One idea that consistently stood out was modularity. Instead of building one large system that does everything, we explored using multiple smaller exploration units. This approach could allow better coverage of an area, provide backup if one unit fails, and support teamwork between devices for data collection and mapping.</p> <p>As our ideas developed further, we started refining the modular approach into more specific system concepts. One idea involved a water exploration setup with multiple stages or detachable subsystems. In this concept, nearby devices could communicate with each other using short-range methods such as sonar, while a surface unit would send collected data back to a mothership using Wi-Fi. At the same time, we explored a hybrid drone/rover concept inspired by R6, designed to work on both land and water. This concept focused on interchangeable components like wheels, propulsion systems, cameras, sonar, and wireless communication to increase flexibility while still being realistic to prototype.</p> <p>Throughout the brainstorming process, several design priorities stayed consistent across all concepts. We wanted to reduce the amount of direct human involvement, improve the accuracy and reliability of the data collected, support automation where possible, and make sure the system could be upgraded over time. Rather than building a one-time prototype, our goal was to create a platform that could improve through testing, modular hardware changes, and sensor-driven data collection. These priorities, along with ease of use and the need to demonstrate meaningful robotics and automation, led us toward an MVP-style approach: building a first version that fits within our constraints while still allowing future expansion.</p>","tags":["EGR314","Team XPED"]},{"location":"02-Concept-Design/Design/#generating-ideas","title":"Generating Ideas","text":"","tags":["EGR314","Team XPED"]},{"location":"02-Concept-Design/Design/#ease-of-deployment-initial-use","title":"Ease of Deployment &amp; Initial Use","text":"Need / Requirement Feature Details Ease of Deployment &amp; Initial Use Throwable chassis Can be tossed into hazardous areas to start a mission quickly.
